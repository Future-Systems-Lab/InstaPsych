# 🧠 InstaPsych System  
Precision Sensory-Pattern Emotional Regulation

InstaPsych is a sensory-regulation prototype that converts user-selected sensations into adaptive hypnotic protocols.  
There are **no emotional labels**, **no diagnostics**, and **no interpretation**.  
The system uses a **psychophysiological mapping model** to detect patterns and match them to sound frequencies, visual entrainment fields, and short linguistic micro-interventions.

The goal is **instant state-matching** with a simple, non-clinical experience.

## 🔍 Interaction Flow

### 1. Multi-Sensation Check-In  
Users select plain-language sensations from three domains:

**Body:** fast heartbeat • tightness • drained • heavy • restless  
**Mind:** racing • foggy • looping • flat • unfocused  
**Experience:** overloaded • detached • keyed-up • withdrawn • overstimulated  

Multiple selections allowed.

### 2. Micro-Questions  
The system asks 1–2 clarifiers only when needed:

- “Mind moving fast or slow?”  
- “Does this feel more physical or mental?”  
- “Silence, voice, or both?”

### 3. Hidden Pattern Mapping  
Behind the scenes, selections map to internal regulation pathways:

- dopamine  
- serotonin  
- GABA  
- endorphin  
- endocannabinoid  

These neurochemical pathways never appear in the UI.  
All mapping is non-diagnostic and sensory-only.

## 🎧 Mode Selection

### **Reflective Hypnosis Mode**  
Silent or near-silent protocols relying on visual entrainment:

- starfields  
- auroras  
- slow geometric pulses  
- kaleidoscopic morphs  
- the InstaPsych seal with rhythmic binary glow  

### **Verbal Mode**  
AI transforms the user’s selected sensations into simple, friendly phrasing and delivers:

- reframes  
- mantras  
- adaptive responses  
- tone modeled from DISC-style patterns

## 🌈 Sensory Engine

### **Audio Profiles (Hz)**  
Automatically chosen based on the detected psychophysiological pattern:

- Calming  
- Grounding  
- Awakening  
- Softening  

### **Color Therapy**  
Subtle visual biasing based on the user’s arousal level and internal pattern family.

### **Visual Entrainment**  
Purpose-built hypnotic fields that support attentional quiet and sensory coherence.

# ♻️ Sustainable Hardware Design

### **Eco-Composite Case**  
The optional wearable charging case is engineered for sustainability:

- **Hemp-fiber composite shell**  
- **Bamboo-charcoal black pigmentation** (naturally matte, non-toxic)  
- **Plant-based inks**  
- **Low-impact manufacturing inputs**  

### **Solar-Assisted Lid**  
A thin photovoltaic layer on the lid decreases reliance on wall charging and aligns the device with low-energy, nature-centered design principles.

### **Biodegradable Color Layering**  
Natural mineral and bamboo-derived tints create the InstaPsych palette without synthetic dyes.

## 🧩 System Philosophy  
InstaPsych does not attempt to understand emotion.  
It identifies **sensations → patterns → protocols**, allowing the nervous system to reorganize itself.

All change is internal; InstaPsych simply aligns to the user’s moment.

## 📦 Status  
Prototype in progress.  
Core sensory-pattern mapping, entrainment engine, and sustainable hardware concepts are complete.
