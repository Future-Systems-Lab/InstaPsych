# 🧠 InstaPsych System  
A User-Input Pattern Interface for Adaptive Sensory Design

InstaPsych is an applied informatics prototype that explores how simple user-input sensations can drive dynamic changes in audiovisual experience. Designed as a non-clinical, sensation-first interface, the system focuses on interaction design, pattern detection, and real-time sensory personalization.

The prototype integrates principles from behavioral design, user-experience research, and immersive interface design to create a fast, lightweight experience centered around visual entrainment, sound modulation, and micro-interaction flow.

## 🔍 Interaction Flow

### **1. Sensation Check-In**  
Users select clear, everyday sensations from three domains:

**Body:** tightness • heavy • restless • drained  
**Mind:** foggy • racing • looping • unfocused  
**Experience:** overloaded • detached • withdrawn • overstimulated  

The language is intentionally plain so users do not need emotional insight or clinical vocabulary.

---

### **2. Micro-Question**  
A single clarifier appears only when required to refine the sensory pattern:

- “Mind moving fast or slow?”  
- “Mind in past or future?”  

This keeps the experience lightweight and intuitive.

---

### **3. Internal Pattern Mapping**  
User selections are translated into internal pattern families rooted in behavioral science and sensory design.  
These patterns guide the choice of sound, color, and visual pacing.  
All mapping happens internally—the interface stays sensation-only and non-diagnostic

This approach aligns with practitioner-level hypnotic methodology and informatics-driven decision design.

---

## 🎧 Mode Selection

### **Reflective Mode (Visual Hypnosis)**  
A minimal, quiet mode built around entrainment visuals:

- starfields  
- auroras  
- geometric pulses  
- kaleidoscopic morphs  
- binary-glow seal animations  

Designed to guide attention inward and facilitate sensory reorganization.

---

### **Verbal Mode (AI-Generated Language)**  
The system generates short, supportive linguistic cues based on the sensations chosen:

- mantras  
- micro-reframes  
- adaptive responses  

Tone shaping draws from communication-pattern modeling, offering a practitioner-aligned style without therapeutic claims.

---

## 🌈 Sensory Engine

### **Audio (Hz) Profiles**  
Automatically selected tones designed for calming, grounding, awakening, or softening responses.

### **Color Fields**  
Gentle arousal-based tinting aligns with the user’s moment without labeling emotion.

### **Visual Entrainment**  
Hypnotic fields built to support attentional quiet, coherence, and internal stability.

# ♻️ Sustainable Hardware Exploration

InstaPsych includes a conceptual wearable case that reflects naturopathic and eco-design principles:

### **Eco-Composite Materials**  
- hemp-fiber composites  
- bamboo-charcoal pigmentation (matte, non-toxic)  
- plant-based inks  
- reduced-impact manufacturing inputs  

### **Solar-Assisted Lid**  
A thin photovoltaic surface reduces reliance on wall charging.

### **Biodegradable Color Layers**  
Mineral- and bamboo-based tints create the InstaPsych palette without synthetic dyes.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy  
InstaPsych supports **sensation → pattern → protocol**, rather than emotion → meaning.  
No analysis, no diagnosis—only responsive sensory organization through design.

All transformation occurs internally; the interface simply aligns with the user’s moment.
